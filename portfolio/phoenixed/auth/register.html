<h4>1. Phoenixed Copy Trading Schedule of Terms And Conditions</h4>
<p>1.1. Phoenixed Copytrading (hereinafter the “copy trade service” or “copy trading services” or “copy trading”) is a service that allows users (a “Copier” or “you” or “your”) to copy trades carried out by other traders (a “Principal” or a “trader”). l You can only be either a Copier or a Principal.</p>
<p>1.2. This Schedule sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when using the copy trade service on our Platform. By proceeding beyond this page, you acknowledge that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms set out in this Schedule.</p>
<p>1.3. The terms in this Schedule apply to you in addition to our Terms and Conditions, which apply to all of our services including copy trading. Where there is a conflict between the Terms and Conditions and this Schedule, the terms of this Schedule shall prevail. Unless otherwise defined, capitalised words in this Schedule will have the same meaning given to those words in the Terms and Conditions. In the case of a conflict the capitalised words in this schedule shall prevail. By using our copy trade service, you agree to the term in this Schedule along with the fees from us or a Principal.</p>

<h4>2. Risk Disclosure</h4>
<p>2.1. Please note that this Risk Disclosure is in addition to any risk disclosure in relation to products traded on our platform. In making a decision to copy a specific trader or traders, strategy and/or portfolio, you should consider your financial situation, including your financial commitments. You should understand that copy trading is highly speculative and that you could sustain significant losses exceeding the principal amount used to copy a trader or traders. You should in particular be aware of the following risks associated with copy trading:</p>
<p>(a) copy trading involves automated trading execution whereby trades are opened and closed in your account without your manual intervention and further instructions from you;</p>
<p>(b) if you manually modify or close an order generated by the Copy Trader functionality, you may achieve a materially different result than the trader that you copied;</p>
<p>(c) copied trades in amounts lower than the minimum trade (as specified on our platform) will not be opened;</p>
<p>(d) if you are copying all trades which are currently open in relation to a Principal you choose to copy, we may open your position at the best available price at the time the trade is copied and not at the price at which the trade being copied was originally opened;</p>
<p>(e) cash-out and withdrawals by the Principal, strategy and/or portfolio you are copying may also generate a materially different result for you than the Principal that you copied. This is due to a number of different factors including your starting account balance, the effect of the difference in trading proportions, the minimum trade size, your account settings, differences in spread, interest and investment price at the time of your investment, and also the difference in fees that may be incurred;</p>
<p>(f) following and/or copying the trading decisions of inexperienced and/or unprofessional traders creates risk and we make no representations as to the level of expertise, skill and care of a particular trader you choose to follow and/or copy;</p>
<p>(g) you may be copying traders whose ultimate purpose or intention, or financial status may differ from yours; and/or</p>
<p>(h) following and/or copying traders or portfolios that trade in, or which include products that are not available to you (whether as a result of Applicable Law or otherwise) and where a replacement equivalent trade cannot be executed may result in the economic performance, portfolio composition, risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio deviating from the portfolio of the copied trader or the Copy Portfolio.</p>

<h4>3. Trade Execution</h4>
<p>3.1. The Platform provides you with the ability to interact, follow and copy other traders, strategies and/or portfolios by using the information, as well as providing you with "social trading features". Social trading features include detailed account information, trading histories, risk profiles, and other information in relation to a Principal’s strategies and/or portfolios that may be useful to you when deciding whether to copy such Principal, strategy and/or portfolio.</p>
<p>3.2. Copy trading is a trading functionality which allows you to copy the account of other traders. You do this by either copying a specific Principal or copying a Copy Portfolio. By placing a copy trade instruction through our Platform, you are authorising and instructing us to execute trades for your account that automatically mirror the account of the Principal to the maximum extent possible subject to limitations in the service or the copy trader functionality which may be disclosed on our Platform from time to time, without any prior consultation, consent of approval. The copy trades may be executed on a pro rata basis and in relation to the same products and the same trading instructions. As a result, we are authorised open and close positions, set limits and perform all other actions necessary to carry out the copy trading service.</p>
<p>3.3. We may be unable to copy trades in exactly the same manner as the Principal or the Copy Portfolio for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(a) such trade may be unavailable to you or your account as a result of Applicable Law or otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) We will not open trades in amounts lower than the minimum trade.</p>
<p>3.4. The copy trade service may result in trades in a number of instruments. Each trade opened on your behalf through copy trading will usually be classified under the same asset class as classified in the copied account.</p>
<p>3.5. If you are restricted from trading a certain asset class or specific product due to Applicable Law, other regulatory requirements or any other reason that we may decide at our sole discretion, then we may at our sole discretion, take reasonable steps, where permitted by Applicable Law and where our service enables this, to ensure that an equivalent or similar trade is opened in your account to replace the restricted trade (for example, replacing a derivative trade with a trade in a similar underlying product or vice versa).</p>
<p>3.6. If we replace a trade for you, we cannot guarantee that the risk rating and economic performance of the replacement trade will match that of the restricted trade. Where in our sole discretion we do not replace a trade with an equivalent or similar trade for any reason, your economic performance, portfolio composition, risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio may deviate from that of the Principal or portfolio being copied.</p>
<p>3.7. Before entering into a copy trade, you will need to have sufficient balances of funds in your account to be put towards a copy trade.</p>
<p>3.8. Where you have insufficient funds, you agree that we shall apply whatever balances that are available in your account to the execution of the trade.</p>
<p>3.9. Where there are no remaining funds in your account to copy a trade, any subsequent copy trade orders will not be placed.</p>
<p>3.10. In ensuring that we are able to copy a trade for you to the maximum extent permissible, you authorise us in our sole discretion to allocate the balance available in your account proportionate to the copied account.</p>
<p>3.11. When we automatically execute an order based on your instruction to copy a trader or a portfolio, we will not be required to seek your consent, prior approval or any confirmation from you prior to and for the execution of such an order.</p>
<p>3.12. There are a number of order restrictions when copy trading, including on the minimum and maximum amount that can be invested in any trader or portfolio that you copy, the minimum amount on any single copy trade, and the maximum number of traders that you can copy. The full restrictions are listed on our website and may be amended from time to time at our sole discretion. Open trades that are in breach of these order restrictions will be closed out at our discretion.</p>
<p>3.13. When you are using our Copy Trader service, you can choose to copy:</p>
<p>(a) all trades which are currently open in a certain account as well as new trades which are opened after you begin to copy the trader in such account; or</p>
<p>(b) only new trades which are opened after you begin to copy the trader's account. This means that we will not copy any trades in the trader's account which were entered into before this point.</p>

<p>4.2. In addition, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, we will not be liable for (i) any actions we take in order to carry out your instructions in relation to a copy trade or (ii) any decisions or actions taken by a Principal or strategy that you have chosen to copy.</p>
<p>4.3. We reserve the right to assess whether copy trading is a suitable investment tool for you and under what conditions (the "Suitability Assessment"). The result of the Suitability Assessment if we should conduct it is determined by information and documents provided to us by you at our request, which you can update at any time.</p>
<p>4.4. We may establish your investment profile on the basis of your Suitability Assessment, and your ability to enter into copy trades may be limited by your Suitability Assessment. If we determine that copy trading is not a suitable investment tool for you, then you will not be permitted to access the copy trading functionalities of our Platform. We are not liable for any losses that you may suffer as a result of providing false or misleading information as part of your Suitability Assessment, including where this leads to us creating an inaccurate investment profile for you.</p>
<p>4.5. Notwithstanding the provision above to the maximum permitted extent under Applicable Law, copy trading shall not amount to any form of investment, portfolio or asset management.</p>
<p>4.6. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, nothing in our copy trade services or functionality shall amount to any personalised investment recommendations, investment advice, tax related advice or other financial advice of any kind.</p>

<p>4.9. We will take reasonable steps to monitor the performance of any copied Principal under the copy trading functionality, as well as the performance of the functionality of our copy trade service.</p>
<p>4.10. We reserve the right to pause, stop, or block: (a) any Principal from being copied under the Copy Trader functionality; and (b) any portfolio or trading strategy from being copied under the Copy Portfolio functionality. In this case, open trades entered into as a result of the Copy Trader or Copy Portfolio functionality will be closed.</p>
<p>4.11. We reserve the right to terminate the Copy Trader or Copy Portfolio service at our discretion (including if you no longer meet the criteria to receive the services or it is not feasible to provide the services as a result of any rules or regulations applicable to us) by giving written notice to you.</p>
<p>4.12. We may also terminate the Copy Trader or Copy Portfolio service if we suspect or have reason to believe that (i) prohibited trading activities, including manipulative or abusive trading activities, are being conducted; (ii) fraudulent of incorrect information has been provided during the account opening process; or (iii) you have otherwise acted in bad faith.</p>
<p>4.13. On a termination of the Copy Trader or Copy Portfolio service, open trades entered into a result of these functionalities will be closed.</p>
<p>4.14. We reserve the right to amend the terms of the copy trader or copy portfolio service without further consent from you.</p>

We do not guarantee the recurrence of past rates of return that have been made by a Principal or portfolio you choose to copy, and the profits (or losses) you make or incur may not match those of a Principal or portfolio you copy.</p>

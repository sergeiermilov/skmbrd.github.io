<h4>1. Phoenixed Copy Trading Schedule of Terms And Conditions</h4>
<p>1.1. Phoenixed Copytrading (hereinafter the “copy trade service” or “copy trading services” or “copy trading”) is a service that allows users (a “Copier” or “you” or “your”) to copy trades carried out by other traders (a “Principal” or a “trader”). l You can only be either a Copier or a Principal.</p>
<p>1.2. This Schedule sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when using the copy trade service on our Platform. By proceeding beyond this page, you acknowledge that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms set out in this Schedule.</p>
<p>1.3. The terms in this Schedule apply to you in addition to our Terms and Conditions, which apply to all of our services including copy trading. Where there is a conflict between the Terms and Conditions and this Schedule, the terms of this Schedule shall prevail. Unless otherwise defined, capitalised words in this Schedule will have the same meaning given to those words in the Terms and Conditions. In the case of a conflict the capitalised words in this schedule shall prevail. By using our copy trade service, you agree to the term in this Schedule along with the fees from us or a Principal.</p>

<h4>2. Risk Disclosure</h4>
<p>2.1. Please note that this Risk Disclosure is in addition to any risk disclosure in relation to products traded on our platform. In making a decision to copy a specific trader or traders, strategy and/or portfolio, you should consider your financial situation, including your financial commitments. You should understand that copy trading is highly speculative and that you could sustain significant losses exceeding the principal amount used to copy a trader or traders. You should in particular be aware of the following risks associated with copy trading:</p>
<p>(a) copy trading involves automated trading execution whereby trades are opened and closed in your account without your manual intervention and further instructions from you;</p>
<p>(b) if you manually modify or close an order generated by the Copy Trader functionality, you may achieve a materially different result than the trader that you copied;</p>
<p>(c) copied trades in amounts lower than the minimum trade (as specified on our platform) will not be opened;</p>
<p>(d) if you are copying all trades which are currently open in relation to a Principal you choose to copy, we may open your position at the best available price at the time the trade is copied and not at the price at which the trade being copied was originally opened;</p>
<p>(e) cash-out and withdrawals by the Principal, strategy and/or portfolio you are copying may also generate a materially different result for you than the Principal that you copied. This is due to a number of different factors including your starting account balance, the effect of the difference in trading proportions, the minimum trade size, your account settings, differences in spread, interest and investment price at the time of your investment, and also the difference in fees that may be incurred;</p>
<p>(f) following and/or copying the trading decisions of inexperienced and/or unprofessional traders creates risk and we make no representations as to the level of expertise, skill and care of a particular trader you choose to follow and/or copy;</p>
<p>(g) you may be copying traders whose ultimate purpose or intention, or financial status may differ from yours; and/or</p>
<p>(h) following and/or copying traders or portfolios that trade in, or which include products that are not available to you (whether as a result of Applicable Law or otherwise) and where a replacement equivalent trade cannot be executed may result in the economic performance, portfolio composition, risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio deviating from the portfolio of the copied trader or the Copy Portfolio.</p>

<h4>3. Trade Execution</h4>
<p>3.1. The Platform provides you with the ability to interact, follow and copy other traders, strategies and/or portfolios by using the information, as well as providing you with "social trading features". Social trading features include detailed account information, trading histories, risk profiles, and other information in relation to a Principal’s strategies and/or portfolios that may be useful to you when deciding whether to copy such Principal, strategy and/or portfolio.</p>
<p>3.2. Copy trading is a trading functionality which allows you to copy the account of other traders. You do this by either copying a specific Principal or copying a Copy Portfolio. By placing a copy trade instruction through our Platform, you are authorising and instructing us to execute trades for your account that automatically mirror the account of the Principal to the maximum extent possible subject to limitations in the service or the copy trader functionality which may be disclosed on our Platform from time to time, without any prior consultation, consent of approval. The copy trades may be executed on a pro rata basis and in relation to the same products and the same trading instructions. As a result, we are authorised open and close positions, set limits and perform all other actions necessary to carry out the copy trading service.</p>
<p>3.3. We may be unable to copy trades in exactly the same manner as the Principal or the Copy Portfolio for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(a) such trade may be unavailable to you or your account as a result of Applicable Law or otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) We will not open trades in amounts lower than the minimum trade.</p>
<p>3.4. The copy trade service may result in trades in a number of instruments. Each trade opened on your behalf through copy trading will usually be classified under the same asset class as classified in the copied account.</p>
<p>3.5. If you are restricted from trading a certain asset class or specific product due to Applicable Law, other regulatory requirements or any other reason that we may decide at our sole discretion, then we may at our sole discretion, take reasonable steps, where permitted by Applicable Law and where our service enables this, to ensure that an equivalent or similar trade is opened in your account to replace the restricted trade (for example, replacing a derivative trade with a trade in a similar underlying product or vice versa).</p>
<p>3.6. If we replace a trade for you, we cannot guarantee that the risk rating and economic performance of the replacement trade will match that of the restricted trade. Where in our sole discretion we do not replace a trade with an equivalent or similar trade for any reason, your economic performance, portfolio composition, risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio may deviate from that of the Principal or portfolio being copied.</p>
<p>3.7. Before entering into a copy trade, you will need to have sufficient balances of funds in your account to be put towards a copy trade.</p>
<p>3.8. Where you have insufficient funds, you agree that we shall apply whatever balances that are available in your account to the execution of the trade.</p>
<p>3.9. Where there are no remaining funds in your account to copy a trade, any subsequent copy trade orders will not be placed.</p>
<p>3.10. In ensuring that we are able to copy a trade for you to the maximum extent permissible, you authorise us in our sole discretion to allocate the balance available in your account proportionate to the copied account.</p>
